    <h3>
      Current Interests
    </h3>

    <p>
    My main current interests are in quantum information theory and quantum complexity theory. I am particularly interested in non-local games and the power of entanglement. I am helping organizing a seminar on this topic at the University of Copenhagen, more information <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/non-local-games">here</a>.

    <h4>
      A Quantum Unique Games Conjecture
    </h4>
    <p>
      Work in collaboration with Hamoon Mousavi. ITCS 2025, QIP 2025. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20028">arXiv</a>.
    </p>

      Abstract: After the NP-hardness of computational problems such as 3SAT and MaxCut was established, a natural next step was to explore whether these problems remain hard to approximate. While the quantum extensions of some of these problems are known to be hard-indeed undecidable-their inapproximability remains largely unresolved. In this work, we introduce definitions for the quantum extensions of Label-Cover and Unique-Label-Cover. We show that these problems play a similarly crucial role in studying the inapproximability of quantum constraint satisfaction problems as they do in the classical setting.

    <h4>
      Approximation Algorithms for Noncommutative Constraint Satifsaction Problems
    </h4>
    <p>
      Work in collaboration with Eric Culf and Hamoon Mousavi. FOCS 2024, QIP 2025. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16765">arXiv</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: Noncommutative constraint satisfaction problems (NC-CSPs) are higher-dimensional operator extensions of classical CSPs. Despite their significance in quantum information, their approximability remains largely unexplored. A notable example of a noncommutative CSP that is not solvable in polynomial time is NC-Max-3-Cut. We present a 0.864-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our approach extends to a broader class of both classical and noncommutative CSPs. We introduce three key concepts: approximate isometry, relative distribution, and *-anticommutation, which may be of independent interest.

    <h4>
      Bootstrapping Quantum Field Theory in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) Space
    </h4>
    <p>
      Work in collaboration with Marco Meineri and Joao Penedones. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP07(2024)229">JHEP</a>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11209">arXiv</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We study correlation functions of the bulk stress tensor and boundary operators in Quantum Field Theories (QFT) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In particular, we derive new sum rules from the two-point function of the stress tensor and its three-point function with two boundary operators. In AdS2, this leads to a bootstrap setup that involves the central charge of the UV limit of the bulk QFT and may allows us to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow non-perturbatively by continuously varying the AdS radius. Along the way, we establish the convergence properties of the newly discovered local block decomposition of the three-point function.

    <h4> Microscopic Derivation of Black Hole Entropy in String Theory</h4>
    <p>
      This is my Master's thesis which I have written under the supervision of Philip Candelas and Chris Beem. It is a review of the seminal paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9601029">arXiv:hep-th/9601029</a> by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa who derived microscopically the entropy of an extremal black hole in type IIB string theory in five non-compact dimensions.

		<h4> Geometric Quantisation of the n-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator </h4>
    <p>
			This is my Bachelor's thesis which I have written under the the supervision of Giovanni Felder and Gabriele Rembado. It is a review of geometric quantisation which consists in constructing a Hilbert space out of sections of a line bundle. A thorough background in differential geometry is also given. The simple example of the n-dimensional harmonic oscillator is worked out explicitly.
