      Current Interests
    </h3>

    <p>
    My main current interests are in theoretical quantum information theory and quantum complexity theory. I am particularly interested in non-local games and the power of entanglement. I am helping organizing a seminar on this topic at the University of Copenhagen, more information <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/non-local-games">here</a>.

    <h4>
      Approximation Algorithms for Noncommutative Constraint Satifsaction Problems
    </h4>
    <p>
      Work in collaboration with Eric Culf and Hamoon Mousavi. You can find the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16765">here</a>.

      Abstract: We study operator - or noncommutative - variants of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). These higher-dimensional variants are a core topic of investigation in quantum information, where they arise as nonlocal games and entangled multiprover interactive proof systems (MIP*). The idea of higher-dimensional relaxations of CSPs is also important in the classical literature. For example since the celebrated work of Goemans and Williamson on Max-Cut, higher dimensional vector relaxations have been central in the design of approximation algorithms for classical CSPs.
      We introduce a framework for designing approximation algorithms for noncommutative CSPs. Prior to this work Max-2-Lin(k) was the only family of noncommutative CSPs known to be efficiently solvable. This work is the first to establish approximation ratios for a broader class of noncommutative CSPs.
      In the study of classical CSPs, k-ary decision variables are often represented by k-th roots of unity, which generalise to the noncommutative setting as order-k unitary operators. In our framework, using representation theory, we develop a way of constructing unitary solutions from SDP relaxations, extending the pioneering work of Tsirelson on XOR games. Then, we introduce a novel rounding scheme to transform these solutions to order-k unitaries. Our main technical innovation here is a theorem guaranteeing that, for any set of unitary operators, there exists a set of order-k unitaries that closely mimics it. As an integral part of the rounding scheme, we prove a random matrix theory result that characterises the distribution of the relative angles between eigenvalues of random unitaries using tools from free probability.

    <h4>
      Bootstrapping Quantum Field Theory in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) Space
    </h4>
    <p>
      Work in collaboration with Marco Meineri and Joao Penedones. You can find the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11209">here</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Abstract: We study correlation functions of the bulk stress tensor and boundary operators in Quantum Field Theories (QFT) in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In particular, we derive new sum rules from the two-point function of the stress tensor and its three-point function with two boundary operators. In AdS2, this leads to a bootstrap setup that involves the central charge of the UV limit of the bulk QFT and may allows us to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow non-perturbatively by continuously varying the AdS radius. Along the way, we establish the convergence properties of the newly discovered local block decomposition of the three-point function.

    <h4> Microscopic Derivation of Black Hole Entropy in String Theory</h4>
    <p>
      This is my Master's thesis which I have written under the supervision of Philip Candelas and Chris Beem. It is a review of the seminal paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9601029">arXiv:hep-th/9601029</a> by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa who derived microscopically the entropy of an extremal black hole in type IIB string theory in five non-compact dimensions.

		<h4> Geometric Quantisation of the n-dimensional Harmonic Oscillator </h4>
    <p>
			This is my Bachelor's thesis which I have written under the the supervision of Giovanni Felder and Gabriele Rembado. It is a review of geometric quantisation which consists in constructing a Hilbert space out of sections of a line bundle. A thorough background in differential geometry is also given. The simple example of the n-dimensional harmonic oscillator is worked out explicitly.
